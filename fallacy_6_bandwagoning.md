# Fallacy #6: Bandwagoning

The bandwagon effect is a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases the more that they have already been adopted by others.

### Cloud Washing

The tsunami of Amazon Web Services (AWS) pulled all the water out of the bay of technology and it was clear to see which vendors were wearing shorts or not.

Those without an answer to public cloud then embarked on what was described as "cloud washing": rebadging existing, non-cloud technologies such as storage arrays as "cloud storage arrays".

If this deception is not detected then IT Pros can be influenced to buy legacy technology with a new shiny cloud badge and think they are doing cloud.

This is happening today where many IT Pro's say they have a "private cloud" when they really refer to a VMware cluster on-premises. This doesn't meet any of the five essential cloud characteristics, but the private cloud bandwagon rolls onwards.

### Certified IT Professionals

Education, training and certification are well proven methods of creating a bandwagon effect in the technology industry. Perversely the vendors can create a profitable business out of what is really a marketing strategy. This means IT Professionals are paying the vendor to do their marketing for them.

Cisco, VMware, Oracle and other hugely successful companies have something in common: a huge attachment of certified IT professionals. These IT Pros align their career with the vendor, such as getting contracts because of their certifications, which creates a strong brand loyalty.

These IT Pros go to the same conferences where they feel a strong sense of camaradrie. Networking is the most important aspect of conferences cited by attendees, far more important to the session content.
