# Fallacy #6: Bandwagoning

The bandwagon effect is a phenomenon whereby the rate of uptake of beliefs, ideas, fads and trends increases the more that they have already been adopted by others.

### Certified IT Professionals

Education, training and certification are well proven methods of creating a bandwagon effect in the technology industry. Perversely the vendors can create a profitable business out of what is really a marketing strategy. This means IT Professionals are paying the vendor to do their marketing for them.

Cisco, VMware, Oracle and other hugely successful companies have something in common: a huge attachment of certified IT professionals. These IT Pros align their career with the vendor, such as getting contracts because of their certifications, which creates a strong brand loyalty.

These IT Pros go to the same conferences where they feel a strong sense of camaradrie. Networking is the most important aspect of conferences cited by attendees, far more important to the session content.
