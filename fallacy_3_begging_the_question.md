# Fallacy #3: Begging the Question

Many English speakers use "beg the question" to mean "raise the question", "evade the question", or even "ignore the question", and follow that phrase with the question, for example: "I weigh 120 kg and have severely clogged arteries, which begs the question: why have I not started exercising?"

### The Elephant In The Room

In the technology industry, in meetings, conferences and panel sessions it is common for representatives to deflect by directing the audience to "the elephant in the room".

This is their big issue that they want the audience to focus on. The audience is likely to go along with this unless their critical thinking detects the fallacy.
