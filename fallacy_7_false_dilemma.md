# Fallacy #7: False Dilemma

A false dilemma involves a situation in which only limited alternatives are considered, when in fact there is at least one additional option. 

The options may be a position that is between two extremes (such as when there are shades of grey) or may be completely different alternatives. Phrasing that implies two options (dilemma, dichotomy, black-and-white) may be replaced with other number-based nouns, such as a "false trilemma" ("false trichotomy," etc.) if something is reduced to only three options.

There are other names for this fallacy:

* false dichotomy
* false binary
* black-and-white thinking
* bifurcation
* oversimplification

The false dilemma is used in the technology industry as a way to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD).

### Going All-In on AWS

The most successful public cloud, AWS, is well known for using the phrase "All-in on AWS". For most of their existence they have insisted that public cloud is everything you need, all you need. 

Enterprises disagreed with this and used AWS for a portion of their IT needs. AWS have since recognised this at Re:Invent conferences and recognise the more hybrid nature of cloud consumption by enterprises. Acknowledging this is good marketing because their audience had already detected the fallacy. However, AWS do not have a good hybrid story and they continue to market customers going "All-in on AWS" which tells you that this belief is in their DNA.

### Data Sovereignty

Regional managed service providers and technology vendors are threatened by public cloud providers so they create false dilemmas in the market. One of them is insisting that data must stay inside the country of origin, so the dilemma is "American Public Cloud" or "European Local Provider".

It is never pleasant to see an industry trend (public cloud) harm regional providers, but it is more unpleasant to see the regional providers use fear, uncertainty and doubt through false dilemmas to influence their customers.

The rules and regulations for data are complex and each organization has to undertake their own assessment and not be influenced by biased vendors who create false dilemmas.

### Surveys Don't Reflect Realities

How often have you heard, "Without data you're just someone with an opinion"? Therefore, the thinking goes, a piece of marketing with numbers and a nice chart is more credible. 

There are a number of problems with the underlying surveys that are used as sources in marketing, but we'll look at just one for the false dilemma.

A survey might reveal that "50% of CIOs are thinking of moving to Public Cloud". That can be translated into "CIOs are split, half are rejecting public cloud and half are going all-in.". The reality is that a CIO is doing both with each CIO along a spectrum of combined use of public cloud and on-premises IT.

Rarely is the underyling survey methodology available, so whilst it is true that without data you just have an opinion, it is also true that with data you just have a bucket of unqualified and misunderstood opinions from people you don't know.
 
### Morton's Fork

Imagine if, whichever choice you made from two options, the answer was always the same vendor.

This is true of so-called hybrid-cloud vendors who claim that people choose one cloud option or the other, but either way this vendor has the answer.

The reallity is that there are more than two needs that the audience has, in this case cloud is not made up of two options. AWS have over fifty cloud services whereas a hybrid cloud vendor will have a fraction of those.
