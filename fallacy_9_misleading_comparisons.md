# Fallacy #9: Misleading Comparisons

Also known as "false analogy", the modern IT Pro will find misleading comparisons everywhere in modern marketing. They are particularly powerful because they can play to the reader's personal bias. 

Take the example of a twenty-year Network Engineer IT Pro. She follows Cisco because she has all her certifications with Cisco. When Cisco say they are a cloud company and they compare themselves to AWS and others, then she is likely to believe them and not apply critical thinking.

To show how extreme these false analogies can be, consider:

The model of the solar system is similar to that of an atom, with planets orbiting the sun like electrons orbiting the nucleus. Electrons can jump from orbit to orbit; so we should study ancient records for sightings of planets jumping from orbit to orbit."

### We Bought a CMP so We Are Now Cloud

The most prevalent example in the technology industry today is non-cloud vendors claiming to be cloud vendors. They aren't. 

The false analogies come in various shapes and sizes, but the most common is: I buy cloud management product X from vendor Y, therefore I am a cloud provider just like AWS. 

This analogy is false because there is no software on the market today that makes you a cloud provider like an AWS, Azure or Google (althought Microsoft Azure is closest). Early OpenStack aficionados compared OpenStack (an OSS product) to AWS (a global cloud service provider) in perhaps the most blatant false analogy of all time.

Being a cloud service provider isn't something you can become by installing some software and putting it online with some billing functions. AWS and Azure spend billions of dollars each year whilst old-school managed service providers are going out of business because skeptical customers know, now, the difference between cloud and not-cloud.
