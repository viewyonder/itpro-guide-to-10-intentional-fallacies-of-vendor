# Fallacy #8: Card Stacking

Card stacking is a propaganda technique that seeks to manipulate audience perception of an issue by emphasizing one side and repressing another. Such emphasis may be achieved through media bias or the use of one-sided testimonials, or by simply censoring the voices of critics.

This fallacy is so obvious it barely needs an explanation, but it's useful to call out some specific technology industry examples starting with the infamous topic of Total Cost of Ownership (TCO).

### Total Cost of Ownership

This is a stalwart of vendor marketing. Big budget vendor A will invest in online tools for their prospects to fill in their own numbers and see the savings over X years. 

Then competitor vendor B dismisses the TCO methodology of vendor A and prospects are left confused or, as they should do anyway, working out their own TCO model to produce a fair comparison.

TCO is often added to with Return on Investment (ROI) projections and claims of Time To Value (TTV). All of which are vendor-biases estimates and should be treated with severely critical analysis.

### Feature, Functions, Speeds and Feeds

Different vendor products in the same market often have differing strengths and weaknesses. Vendors therefore create content to stack the cards for their strengths, and make disparaging (if any) comments about weaknesses not being of interest or worth.

There is a reversal of this where vendor A will stack a report not just for their own strengths but will prioritise an all-out attack on their competitors' weaknesses. An example would be an "all flash array" vendor highlighting the benefits of flash storage and demonizing the competition that don't have that capability, although all-flash isn't appropriate all of the time and the competitors' mixed-media might be the best option for some customers.

A third version of this is for a vendor to cleverly turn their perceived weaknesses into strengths. If their product is, for example, considered inflexible with limited configurations they can highlight this is "a robust, well engineered product with low configuration drift and entropy." 

Equally they will card stack by describing a more flexible competitor as a "shambolic array of incompatible options leaving customers at risk of investing significant capital into something that just won't work."
