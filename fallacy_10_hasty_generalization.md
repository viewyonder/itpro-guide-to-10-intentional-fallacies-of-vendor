# Fallacy #10: Hasty Generalization

A Hasty Generalization is based on insufficient evidence, essentially making a hasty conclusion without considering all of the variables.

Other names:

* Generalization from the particular
* Jumping to a conclusion
* Hasty induction
* Law of small numbers
* Unrepresentative sample

This is a common fallacy used by startups in the technology industry where they seek to amplify themselves into the general market. They will take their handful of customers and extrapolate their success to the wider multi-billion dollar market.

### This Is The Year of VDI

For the many years that the Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) solution has been in existence for multiple vendors, IT professionals have been waiting for "The Year of VDI" when the solution becomes ubiquitous. Early successes were highlighted and the problems subdued, and from this small sample a bright future was predicted. The market never reached its potential despite all the marketing hype from those few early samples.

### Everyone Needs Hybrid Cloud

Because today many enterprises use a mixture of on-premises IT and public cloud (mostly separately) then the legacy vendors are jumping on the cloud bandwagon by claiming this as the future operating model in the form of hybrid cloud. 

Whilst new startups develop their applications on the public cloud, called cloud native, the enterprises still do what they've always done. This is less because it's the right thing to do in the future and more because organizations find it hard to change behaviour. "Nobody got fired for buying Big Blue" is the old adage.
