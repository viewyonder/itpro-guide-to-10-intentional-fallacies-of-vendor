# Fallacy #2: Insulting Someone's Character

An ad hominem (Latin for "to the man" or "to the person"), short for *argumentum ad hominem*, is an attack on an argument made by attacking the character, motive, or other attribute of the person making the argument, rather than attacking the argument directly

This kind of fallacious reasoning is frowned upon by customers who consider it disgraceful for vendors to beat each other up in public. In the technology industry this can be an insult against the company or representatives of the company.

### Not all insults are fallacious

However, sometimes this criticism is not fallacious if it relates to statements of fact. An example would be a company claiming a merger will make them the biggest, most successful vendor in a specific category. If they have carried out mergers and made this claim before and that didn't work, then it is not fallacious to question their statement.

### MRDA: He Would Say That, Wouldn't He?

It is very common in the technology industry to see a marketing claim rebutted with MRDA: The Mandy Rice Davies Affair.

During the [Profumo Affair](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Profumo_affair) in 1961, witness Mandy Rice Davies famously said "He would say that, wouldn't he?" when questioned on the defendant's denial of using call-girls. Her point was that a man in a prominent position, accused of an affair with a call-girl, would deny the claim whether it was true or false. His denial, in itself, provides little evidence against the claim of an affair.

You are likely to see the hashtag #MRDA added to vendor representative tweets on Twitter, such as when a vendor with only one widget says that widget is the best way to achieve something. This is usually done in an insulting manner with colloquial insults such as "that's what a one-trick pony would say!"
