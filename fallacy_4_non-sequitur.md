# Fallacy #4: Non Sequitur

A *non sequitur* (Latin for "it does not follow") is an argument in which its conclusion does not follow from its premises. In a non sequitur, the conclusion could be either true or false, but the argument is fallacious because there is a disconnection between the premise and the conclusion.

* There will be billions of devices in the Internet of Things by 2020, and our Hybrid Cloud will be number one in the market.
* Public cloud is the fastest growing market in IT today. Our SDN product will give enterprises new ways to connect and manage their networks.
