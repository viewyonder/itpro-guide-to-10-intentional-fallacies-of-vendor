# Fallacy #1: The Red Herring

A [Red Herring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ignoratio_elenchi) is a fallacy in which an irrelevant topic is presented in order to divert attention from the original issue. The basic idea is to "win" an argument by leading attention away from the argument and to another topic.

A Red Herring is known by many other names:

* Missing the point
* Ignoring the issue
* Irrelevant conclusion
* Ignoratio Elenchi  


### Examples outside of the tech industry

A: Does the law allow me to do that?

B: The law should allow you to do that because this and that.

Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Sherlock Holmes: Hound of the Baskervilles presents a classic example of a red herring. The readers are thrown off the real murderer and start suspecting the escaped “convict” and “Barrymore”. In the end, however, the mystery is resolved by the unexpected confession of “Beryl” that her husband “Stapleton” was the real culprit and was behind the whole mystery of the killer “Hound”.

## The Fake Expert Content

The most classic case of a Red Herring in the IT industry is the "Expert Commentary". This could be in the form of any kind of content: a white paper, a report or a blog. The key to this Red Herring is the claimed authority of the expert. If the expert is no such thing, does the content still stand up to reasoning?

How do you know someone is not an expert? Use these questions:

1.  Do their peers recognise them as experts?
2.  What practical experience do they have (practice before preaching)?
3.  What is their body of work on this subject?
4.  What is their known position (bias) on this subject?
5.  Are they paid to write the content (bias)?

The last point is especially important because bias is one reason people will put Red Herrings in content. A report should say who commissioned and paid for it. If it doesn't, then you can ask the author who did via a private email or a public tweet. 

Unfortunately this also extends to customer use cases. If a customer is used to promote a product, ask why they are taking important time out of their busy lives to support a vendor. What's in it for them?

## Blinded by Celebrity Glamour

It is considered "cool marketing" to bring well known celebrity figures into marketing events. A common example is celebrity keynote speakers who have no connection to the vendor products or services at all. 

Marketing teams will create tenuous links between the vendor and the celebrity by weaving grand themes like saving the planet, saving the children, feeding the poor, and connecting the planet.

The fallacious reasoning works like this: An IT Pro is influenced to buy a hybrid cloud because the vendor and the IT Pro's employer want to be seen in a positive light. That doesn't make sense at all, that's why it's fallacious, but it is what the marketing is saying if you can see past the glamour.
