# Fallacy #5: False Cause and Effect

Common in the news where sensational headlines claim "Since event Y followed event X, event Y must have been caused by event X." It is often shortened to simply *post hoc fallacy*.

A famous example:

The rooster crows immediately before sunrise; therefore the rooster causes the sun to rise.

Other types of this fallacy:

* Confirmation bias
* Superstition
* Jumping to conclusions
* Magical thinking
* Cargo cult

### Fake It 'Till You Make It

There is often a fight between vendors as to who was the originator of a market. We see this today in the Hyperconverged Infrastructure (HCI) market where early entrants are small companies and late-comers are large corporations.

When a market has been in existence for a few years and has proven demand, then a large corporation will enter that market either through their own "innovation" (usually copying the early entrants' product or service), or acquisition.

The large corporation will then make claims that they came up with the idea all along and they are the market leader. 

These "first to market" claims are simply rebutted by using Google Trends to search for mentions of different products over years and is enough to get a sense of who was in the market and when.
